# AK Sports Channel
This is a simple website I built to practice web development. It includes a homepage with a navigation bar, an introduction to AK Sports, and sections on indoor and outdoor sports. There's also a footer with links to other pages. I used HTML and CSS to create the layout and design. It's just a basic project to help me apply what Iâ€™ve learned so far.
